# Installation

This template is ment to be customized and used as a foundation to create your own personal unity project setup, but contains my personal preferences.

1. To use this unity project template, first press the green "Use this template" button and create a new repository.

3. Then clone the repository as you would normally.
4. After opening the project with Unity Hub, you can get my project setup by pressing the `Tools` button, then `Setup` and lastly `Create Project Setup` to automatically create my personal:
   - Project Directory Structure
   - Files (only `.cs` and `.txt` at this point)
   - Project Settings (not yet implemented)

Alternatively you can go to the `Packages` folder in the assets and search a package named ... (not yet implemented) and customize it to your needs. 

Detailed explanations on how to customize the package will be added in future updates.
